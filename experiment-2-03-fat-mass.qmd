      vjust = 0.5,
      hjust = 0.5
      )
    )

# Show the plot

```

The data for all groups seems to increase linearly over time. However, the slope seems to be greater for HFD-VS than the other two groups in both sexes.

# Summarize

First, let's create a new dataframe called "model_data" and calculate the rate of each subject's fat mass slope over time.

```{r}
#| label: model-data

# Create a new data frame called model_data
model_data <-
  
  # Copy the original dataframe
  mydata |>

  # Compute each subject's fat mass slope
  group_by(id) |>
  mutate(
    fat_mass_slope = 
      (fat_mass - lag(fat_mass)) / (day - lag(day))
  ) |>
  ungroup() |> 
  
  # Select only the relevant columns
  select(
    id, sex, sex_sum, diet, fat_mass_slope
  ) |>
  
  # Drop na values
  drop_na(fat_mass_slope)

# Show a summary of the data
summary(model_data)
```

## Bar Plot

```{r}
#| label: bar-plot

# Create a bar plot of each group's fat mass slope
bar_plot <-
  model_data |>  
  ggplot(
    aes(
      x     = diet, 
      y     = fat_mass_slope, 
      color = diet, 
      fill  = diet,
      shape = diet
      )
    ) +
  
  # Facet by sex
  facet_grid(
    . ~ sex,
    ) + 
  
  # Plot the observed means as points
  stat_summary(
    fun = mean,
    geom = "bar",
    color = "black",
    ) +
  
  # Plot the observed standard errors as errorbars
  stat_summary(
    fun.data = mean_se,
    geom = "errorbar",
    color = "black",
    width = 0.2
    ) +
  
  # Plot individual data points
  geom_point(
    position = position_jitter(
      width = 0.2
    )
  ) +
  
  # Change color title and scale
  scale_color_manual(
    name = "Diet",
    values = c(
      "CHOW"      = "black",
      "HFD-VS"    = "firebrick4",
      "HFD-C8/10" = "dodgerblue4"
      )
    ) +
  
  # Change fill title and scale
  scale_fill_manual(
    name = "Diet",
    values = c(
      "CHOW"      = "ivory3",
      "HFD-VS"    = "firebrick2",
      "HFD-C8/10" = "dodgerblue2"
      )
    ) +
  
  # Change shape title and scale
  scale_shape_manual(
    name = "Diet",
    values = c(
      "CHOW"      = 15,
      "HFD-VS"    = 16,
      "HFD-C8/10" = 18
      )
    ) +
  
  # Change x-axis title
  labs(x = "Diet") +
  
  # Change y-axis title and scale
  scale_y_continuous(
    name = "Fat Mass Slope (g/day)",
    limits = c(0, 6),
    breaks = seq(from = 0, to = 6, by = 2)
  ) +
  
  # Change overall plot theme
  theme_bw() + 
  
  # Remove x-axis tick labels
  theme(
    axis.title.x = element_blank(),
    axis.text.x  = element_blank(),
    axis.ticks.x = element_blank()
    ) 

# Show the plot
bar_plot
```

It looks like HFD-VS has a greater body weight slope than the other groups in both sexes.

# Model

To test the effects of sex, diet, and their interaction on the slope of fat mass (i.e., the rate of fat mass gain) over the course of the dietary intervention, a multiple linear regression model will be built to predict fat mass gain (in g/day) with sex (sum-coded, Levels: male = 1, female = -1), diet (treatment coded, levels: CHOW, HFD-VS, and HFD-C8/10), and their interaction.

```{r}
#| label: model

# Build the model
model <- lm(
  fat_mass_slope ~ sex_sum * diet, 
  data = model_data
  )
```

## Assumptions

Before I run any statistical tests, let's check how well the model satisfies the assumptions.

First, I need to add the fitted and residual values to the data.

```{r}
#| label: model-fits

# Add the fitted and residual values to the dataset
model_fits <- 
  model_data |>
  mutate(
    fits = c(fitted(model)),
    resids = c(residuals(model))
  )
```

### Linearity and Homoskedasticity

Next, I will create a residuals plot to check for linearity and homoskedasticity.

```{r}
#| label: residuals-plot

# Create a residuals plot to check for linearity and homoskedasticity
residuals_plot <-
  model_fits |>
  ggplot(
    aes(x = fits, y = resids)
  ) +
  
  # Plot individual data points
  geom_point() +
  
  # Plot a horizontal line at y = 0
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, col = "red") + 
  
  # Change aesthetics
  labs(
    title = "Residuals vs Predicted Values",
    x = "Predicted Values",
    y = "Residuals"
  ) +
  theme_bw() 

# Show the plot
residuals_plot
```

The data seem to be linear and homoskedastic.

### Normality

Next, I will create a QQ plot to check for normality.

```{r}
#| label: qq-plot

# Create a QQ plot to check for normality
qq_plot <-
  model_fits |>
  ggplot(
    aes(sample = resids)
  ) +
  
  # Plot points and qq line
  geom_qq() +
  geom_qq_line(col = "red") +
  
  # Change aesthestics
  labs(
    title = "Normal QQ Plot",
    x = "Theoretical",
    y = "Sample"
  ) +
  theme_bw() 

# Show the plot
qq_plot
```

The data seem to mostly fall on the qq line (although there is some deviance on the lower end), indicating that the data are approximately normally distributed.

## Omnibus Tests

With the model built, let's perform omnibus tests for the effects of each predictor using the function "anova()". This function uses type I sum of squares. Thus, it will produce F test statistics for the effects of each predictor entered sequentially (i.e., the residual effect of each predictor after accounting for the effects of all the other predictors entered in the model before it).

```{r}
#| label: model-omnibus

# Perform omnibus F tests
model |> anova()
```

There was a main effect of sex, $F(1, 41) = 22.53, p < .001$, diet, $F(2, 41) = 84.35, p < .001$, and a two-way interaction between sex and diet, $F(2, 41) = 4.88, p = .013$.

## Reference = CHOW

Let's produce the summary output.

```{r}
#| label: model-summary

# Show summary output
model |> summary()
```

Overall, the model explained 83% of the variance in average energy intake; and, after adjusting for the number of predictors, it explained 81%, $F(5, 41) = 40.20, R^2 = 0.83, R^2_{adj} = 0.81, p < .001$.

Across the sexes, HFD-VS ($B = 1.38, SE = 0.12, p < .001$) but not HFD-C8/10 ($B = 0.14, SE = 0.11, p = .239$) gained significantly more fat mass per day than CHOW. Although there was not a significant difference between male and female CHOW ($B = 0.12, SE = 0.08, p = .133$), the difference between HFD-VS and CHOW as significantly greater in males than females ($B = 0.33, SE = 0.12, p = .007$). The difference between HFD-C8/10 and CHOW (or lack thereof) was not significantly difference between the sexes ($0.04, SE = 0.11, p = .742$)

## Reference = HFD-VS

To compare HFD-C8/C10 with HFD-VS, let's relevel the diet variable to make HFD-VS the reference group, then refit the model and produce the summary output. (There is no need to rerun the omnibus tests, as the "total" effects are already captured, and thus the output would be identical).

```{r}
#| label: model-vs

# Relevel factors to change reference group to HFD-VS
model_data_vs <- 
  model_data |>
  mutate(
    diet = fct_relevel(diet, "HFD-VS"), # relevel diet
  )

# Build the model
model_vs <- 
  model |>
  update(
    data = model_data_vs
  )

# Produce the summary output
model_vs |> summary()
```

Across the sexes, HFD-C8/10 gained significantly less fat mass per day than HFD-VS ($B = -1.25, SE = 0.12, p < .001$); and the magnitude of this difference was greater in males than females ($B = -0.29, SE = 0.12, p =.015$).
